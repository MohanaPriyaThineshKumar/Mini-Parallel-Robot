Kinematics

Number of links = 8  
Number of Spherical Joints = 6  
DOF ( Degree of freedom) of spherical joints = 3  

Constraints caused by each closed loop = 6  
Number of closed loops = 3  
Constraints causedbyt each motor = 1  
Number of motors = 3  

Using Gruber's Formulae:-


= 6(8-6-1) + 6(3)-6(3) -3(1) 
= 3

DOF of system = 3
