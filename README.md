Kinematics

Number of links (L) = 8  
Number of Spherical Joints (J) = 6  
DOF ( Degree of freedom) of spherical joints (f) = 3  

Constraints caused by each closed loop = 6  
Number of closed loops = 3  
Constraints caused by each motor = 1  
Number of motors = 3  

Using Gruber's Formulae:-

= 6(8-6-1) + 6(3)-6(3) -3(1) 
= 3

DOF of system = 3
